        <h2>What is this?</h2>
		The world as we know it is very much set up for us to do the same thing over and over and over. It's very easy to do spend months at a time doing nothing new or interesting at all.
		We thought it would be good to get a bunch of ideas and try and find a system to encourage ourselves and others to try them. So, here is a fairly rudimentary site that offers you up 
		three tiny seeds for an adventure. Go and do one. And then suggest an adventure yourself.
		
		
        <h2>Here's the rules</h2>
        <ul>
		   <li>We give you a random thing to do (well, 3 and you choose one</li>
           <li>You have a month to do the thing </li>
           <li>You should document the thing in some way to share (a photo, video, some words)</li>
           <li>IF you post about it on twitter you can use the hashtag #AMPDG</li>
           <li>You should add ideas to the ideas pool in return</li>

 <h3>Do I have to be a  broodingly soulful young man to participate? </h3>
 No! You can be any person of any gender or degree of brooding soulfulness. That's just a bit from wikipedia describing the natural prey of the manic pixie dreamgirl.
 <br />
 <h3>Why is it called Automanic Pixie Dream Girl? That's a kinda crappy trope isn't it?</h3>
 Yes it is! But it doesn't matter that the website os two dimensional with no real personality of it's own. It's a website, not a person.
 That aside, it seemed like an appropriate name for something which encourages people to have very very small adventures to shake them out of their humdrum lives.
 <br />
 <h3>Why is this website not very good?</h3>
 Because I don't really know how to write react yet. I'm working on it!
