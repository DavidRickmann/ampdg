# AMPDG

the Automanic Pixie Dream Girl is a site where you can have a small adventure and suggest small advetures for others.

At the moment it offers you up 3 adventures from the initial list and then shows you how to submit your own adventures.

## More things to come:
(Some of these things will need me to be much better at react than I am, which currently is not very)

* A nice little descriptor at the top to better explain the concept.
(and to explain why MPDG is a bad trope, and why evenknowing that we chose to use it)
(and to also explain that users do not need to be male, or soulful, or brooding to use the site)

* A FAQ page.

* Users should be able to sign in to their own page. 
    - That page would show:
        - current tiny adventure
        - previous tiny adventures (and notes they made about it)
        - other friends who use ampdg
        - any adventures they have submitted and how many people have selected/done them
        - a group of other ampdg users (if you have joined a group, and their most recent tiny adventure) 

* Better randomisation function that doesn't pick duplicated.

* A button that you can use (once signed in) to choose your adventure.
