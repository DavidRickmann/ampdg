# AMPDG

the Automanic Pixie Dream Girl is a site where you can have a small adventure and suggest small advetures for others.

At the moment it offers you up 3 adventures from the initial list and then shows you how to submit your own adventures.

## More things to come:
(Some of these things will need me to be much better at react than I am, which currently is not very)

* Users should be able to sign in to their own page. 
    - That page would show:
        - current tiny adventure
        - previous tiny adventures (and notes they made about it)
        - other friends who use ampdg
        - any adventures they have submitted and how many people have selected/done them
        - a group of other ampdg users (if you have joined a group, and their most recent tiny adventure) 

* A button that you can use (once signed in) to choose your adventure.
